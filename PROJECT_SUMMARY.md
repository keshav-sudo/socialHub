## üéØ How Everything Works Together

### Architecture Summary

```
Client ‚Üí Nginx Gateway ‚Üí Microservices ‚Üí Databases
                ‚Üì
         JWT Validation (Auth Service)
                ‚Üì
    User Payload Injected ‚Üí Target Service
                ‚Üì
         Process Request ‚Üí Publish Events (Kafka)
                ‚Üì
    Event Consumers (Notification, Feed)
```

### Key Components

1. **Gateway (Nginx)**
   - Entry point for all requests
   - JWT authentication via `auth_request`
   - Routes to appropriate service
   - Handles CORS, load balancing

2. **Auth Service**
   - User registration & login
   - JWT token generation
   - Token validation for gateway
   - Password reset with OTP

3. **Users Service**
   - User profiles
   - Follow/unfollow relationships
   - Soft delete pattern
   - Publishes events to Kafka

4. **Post Service**
   - Create/read posts
   - Media upload (Cloudinary)
   - Comments & likes
   - Publishes events to Kafka

5. **Chat Service**
   - Real-time WebSocket messaging
   - Redis Pub/Sub for multi-instance
   - Room-based chat
   - Message history

6. **Notification Service**
   - Consumes Kafka events
   - Creates notifications
   - MongoDB for high-volume writes
   - Mark as read/unread

7. **Feed Service**
   - Personalized feed generation
   - Redis caching
   - Consumes Kafka for real-time updates

### Communication Patterns

#### 1. Synchronous (REST API)
```
Client ‚Üí Gateway ‚Üí Auth ‚Üí Response
Client ‚Üí Gateway ‚Üí Auth ‚Üí Users ‚Üí Response
Client ‚Üí Gateway ‚Üí Auth ‚Üí Post ‚Üí Response
```

#### 2. Asynchronous (Event-Driven)
```
Post Service ‚Üí Kafka ‚Üí Notification Service
Users Service ‚Üí Kafka ‚Üí Notification Service
Post Service ‚Üí Kafka ‚Üí Feed Service
```

#### 3. Real-time (WebSocket)
```
Client ‚Üî Chat Instance 1 ‚Üî Redis Pub/Sub ‚Üî Chat Instance 2 ‚Üî Client
```

### Data Flow Example: Creating a Post

1. **Client sends request**
   ```
   POST /posts/ + JWT + media files
   ```

2. **Gateway processes**
   ```
   - Validates JWT via Auth Service
   - Gets user payload
   - Forwards to Post Service
   ```

3. **Post Service processes**
   ```
   - Receives request + user payload
   - Uploads media to Cloudinary
   - Creates post in PostgreSQL
   - Publishes event to Kafka
   - Returns response immediately
   ```

4. **Event consumers process (async)**
   ```
   Notification Service:
   - Consumes event
   - Creates notification in MongoDB
   
   Feed Service:
   - Consumes event
   - Updates feed cache
   ```

5. **Client receives response**
   ```
   HTTP 201 Created + post data
   (Notification appears seconds later)
   ```

## üîß Quick Reference

### Start Services

```bash
# Infrastructure only
docker compose up -d redis kafka

# All services
docker compose up -d

# Specific service
docker compose up -d SERVICE_NAME
```

### Check Status

```bash
# All containers
docker compose ps

# Logs
docker compose logs -f SERVICE_NAME

# Verify setup
./verify-setup.sh
```

### Test API

```bash
# Register
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test","email":"test@example.com","username":"test","password":"Pass123!"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"identifier":"test@example.com","password":"Pass123!"}'

# Use token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/posts/
```

### Troubleshoot

```bash
# Check logs
docker compose logs SERVICE_NAME | grep error

# Restart service
docker compose restart SERVICE_NAME

# Rebuild service
docker compose up -d --build SERVICE_NAME

# Full reset (‚ö†Ô∏è deletes data)
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d
```

## üéì Learning Path

To understand the system:

1. **Start Here:** [README.md](./README.md)
   - Understand architecture
   - See technology stack

2. **Setup:** [docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md](./docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md)
   - Install and configure
   - Get everything running

3. **Understand Flow:** [docs/CODE_FLOW.md](./docs/CODE_FLOW.md) ‚≠ê **MOST IMPORTANT**
   - How requests flow through system
   - How services communicate
   - How events work
   - How WebSocket works

4. **Test APIs:** [docs/API_TESTING.md](./docs/API_TESTING.md)
   - Try all endpoints
   - Understand responses

5. **Deep Dive:** Service READMEs
   - Understand each service in detail
   - See implementation specifics

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

After setup, ensure:

- [ ] All Docker containers are running
- [ ] Redis responds to PING
- [ ] Kafka broker is started
- [ ] All services respond to HTTP requests
- [ ] Can register new user
- [ ] Can login and get JWT token
- [ ] Can access protected endpoints with token
- [ ] Can create post with media
- [ ] Notifications appear after actions
- [ ] WebSocket chat connects and works
- [ ] Events flow through Kafka

Run `./verify-setup.sh` to check all of the above automatically!

## üöÄ What's Scalable About This

1. **Stateless Services**
   - All services use JWT (no session storage)
   - Can run multiple instances easily
   - Load balancer distributes requests

2. **Event-Driven**
   - Services don't wait for each other
   - Kafka buffers high traffic
   - Can add more consumers

3. **Database Per Service**
   - Each service has own database
   - Can scale databases independently
   - Can use different database types

4. **Caching Strategy**
   - Redis for hot data
   - Reduces database load
   - Sub-millisecond response times

5. **Real-time Scaling**
   - Redis Pub/Sub synchronizes chat instances
   - Can run 100+ chat servers
   - Users distributed across instances

6. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Add more instances when needed
   - Kubernetes ready
   - Auto-scaling possible
